# Code of Conduct

## Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, healthy and thriving environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone; discrimination will not be tolerated.

## Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism and taking notice of other criticism
* Focusing on what is best for everyone
* Showing empathy towards others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Any actions considered illegal in most judicially developed nations
* Any actions against the interests of the knowledgable majority
* These include derogatory comments and personal attacks
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Community members are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening or harmful.  
Reasons for moderation decisions will be communicated when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and when an individual is representing the community.  
Examples of representing our community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. 

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at mazupy+kairyou@posteo.net. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.  
All team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
