# Code of Conduct

## Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and thriving environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, discrimination will not be tolerated.

## Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism and taking notice of other criticism
* Focusing on what is best for everyone
* Showing empathy towards others

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Any actions considered illegal in most judicially developed nations
* Any actions against the interests of the knowledgable majority
* These include derogatory comments and personal attacks
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at [no e-mail yet, issue tracker is the only possiblity, I think]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org) - [v1.4](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/)
